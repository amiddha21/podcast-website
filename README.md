# website-tutorial
This is a base model for a podcast/blog website I am building. 
Website uses Redux on the front-end to manage state of likes/comments/users, 
React to handle the UI of the front-end, 
Express to host the website (will deploy to AWS when done), and 
PSQL to store user likes/comments/profile data.
